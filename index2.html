<h1> Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>

<h2> Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review) Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. 
        You now need to critically review your website. 
        To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. 
        </h2>
<h3>
        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
</h3>
<p>
        In review of my website, I will first review the tools used to create the website. I used visual studio code to store all of my code from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. VSC was very useful in the development process as it allows for even a beginner such as myself to come to terms with the coding world. However, VSC was quite confusing to use, as it has very weak built in tutorials and without additional support VSC would have been a difficult entry platform to begin coding with. Despite this, VSC was still useable with the correct teaching and training but I am eager to explore other types of coding software and hopefully find one with a more interactive interface. 

        Trello, on the other hand, was useful from start to finish. By setting my tasks on Trello I always knew where I currently stood in regards to my project and at a glance, could see the areas I still needed to work on. Therefore I was very efficient in developing the website due to Trello’s KanBan methodology. However, after doing a lot of research, Trello’s security is not the most secure and for future projects if I choose to use Trello, I will take additional steps to protect all information put onto Trello. Alternatively I might search for a more secure service like Trello, but a version that doesn’t cap your file attachments in megabytes.  
        
</p>
<br>
<h3>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
</h3>
<br>
<p>
        I found that the IT tools selected were very appropriate for the task I was given. Trello served to make my workload easier to manage and track whereas VSC allowed me to build and debug modern web and cloud applications.  VS Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. Therefore VSC was very appropriate, while there are many alternatives such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, UltraEdit and many more, I am not as experienced in them and it could have been detrimental to my project if I was to switch or change software mid development. In the future, I fully intend to experiment with these other free services to find the one that works best with my particular style of coding. 

</p>
<br>
<h3>
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 

</h3>
<br>
<p>
        The main strength of my final project is my usage of buttons to hide and display large bodies of text. At first I thought this would be a hindrance to the user but now I find that it saves a lot of space on the web page while also allowing users to skip past questions that they may not be as interested in. Additionally my webpage naturally comes dark mode enabled, this is often an overlooked feature in my opinion as many websites can be blindingly bright when opened in a dark environment. However, I would have liked to have added a light mode option as well, most probably via a switch in the top corner of the page that would toggle between light and dark mode. This way everyone wins and you increase the chances of individuals fully viewing your web page.  

        However, not everything went as I would have liked it too. For example, I feel that the design of my website is lacking in a lot of ways. I am not a designer and would never claim to be one. But I couldn’t decide upon a theme for the website other than I wanted it to be dark. As a result the end product came out without a concrete theme running throughout and I feel as if this is a missed opportunity. 
        
        I also wanted to add more personalisation to my website but was restricted with time constraints. Not time constraints to do with building the website, I wanted to record myself playing the piano and have that running somewhere on the website. But unfortunately I was unable to find the time to record the footage for my website. While the site runs fine without it, I wanted to add some more personalisation to the website to make it feel more personal to the user. 
        
        If I could change anything, I would change the design of the website. In hindsight, I am not a fan of the open and empty layout my page has. I would have much preferred to have had a more busy looking site as the implementation of the buttons I like, but as a consequence the web page looks desolate. To offset this I would have aligned all of the questions into groups and flex’d them together. This way by having the questions appear in rows of 3 the website would look a lot less empty. Alternatively, just redesign it all again and have each question on it’s own webpage that is accessed via a drop down box. 
        
</p>
<br>
<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
</h3>
    <br>
<p>In regards to improvements I could make to the project, I would further improve upon the information presented. Currently, I find it to be a bit plain, text isn’t exactly the most interesting thing in the world to look at but I still could have made more changes to the boxes or the background of the text to make it stand out more. The project has come off as a bit too black and white, which would have been great as a theme, why didn’t I make the theme of the website black and white like an old movie? That’s a great idea. Shame I just had it now. So I would also improve upon the theme of the project, either by selecting a theme or fully committing to the black and white theme. Despite this all, I am still quite pleased with how my first website has came out. While there are a lot of areas I would like to continue working on, the website is fully fit for function. 

    </p>

<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
        Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs
        Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems
</h3>
<br>
<p>Here I will review the outcomes to check that they are fit for purpose. Firstly, I believe I did use appropriate IT systems and software for the task I was given. My usage of Trello, VSC and GitHub have all been beneficial software that has propelled me further into the coding field and have also been very useful resources during this project. However, I did encounter numerous bugs with almost all the software I used. To overcome this I had to test for solutions but the easiest solution is often just to Google your current issues. This worked for me as I was struggling to get my buttons on the page to work as intended, as the page would open with the button already pressed. Through internet searching and trial and error I was able to overcome this bug and my buttons are more fully operational. The issue was already well documented on GitHub and W3 schools which both explained ways around the bug although the solution I ended up using was not posted online. To further improve ongoing use of IT tools, I should probably post my solution to GitHub too. 
    </p>
<br>
<h3>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 

        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
</h3>
<br>
<p>The main tool that boosted my efficiency was Trello. The KanBan method made my workflow much more efficient as even after a long hazy weekend I could come back, look at my Trello board and know exactly what I should tackle next. The only downside to Trello is that it has to all be input manually. The only reason this is an issue is because it allows for human error to occur, either forgetting to update Trello or to adequately protect your data on Trello can still occur. 

        I could have been more efficient however, most of the code I used has already been written a million times by millions of people. Later on in the task I found it to be much faster to copy and paste the code from online rather than writing it out myself (and I am a very fast typer). I think the reason I didn’t employ more of this is because it didn’t really feel right. However, given the vastness of code you can find online, I do not think I should worry about this. To overcome this, in the future I will have a file full of all the code I know and use regularly so that I can copy and paste from that file instead of typing it out myself or wasting time looking online. 
        
        Lastly, I do believe that this project could have been done more efficiently if we had done the project in a team. If we had done this project as a team we could have broken down the workload into segments and had individuals focus down segments of work that way. Alternatively for larger projects such as our current one, it would have been possible for more than 1 individual to have worked directly on the website. The only downside with working in teams is when it is a creative project like this one, it is possible that you can get clashes due to design ideas. But hopefully most teams do not have such adamant individuals.

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<br>
<p>There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency when working on projects. The main one which I have discussed before is the use of Trello which improves productivity and efficiency by letting people create boards and use the KanBan method to view their workflow in real time. 

        Additionally, taking breaks is an understated variable when it comes to productivity and efficiency. By taking a break or a stand up, individuals are given a chance to recuperate both their body and their energy which understandably makes individuals more productive. Try taking breaks away from your employees and see how it affects their productivity.
        </p>
<br>
<h3>
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
       
</h3>
<br>
<p>Other than the methods listed in the previous question, you can use various websites such as GitHub, W3 schools and many more for assistance in coding. Many of these websites have code readily available for public use and also serve as a discussion board for issues and bugs developers face using IT. By being active and utilizing these web services developers can be even more efficient by copying existing code instead of writing their own from scratch as well as helping them overcome obstacles that might be hampering their productivity.  

        Team work would have helped productivity as well, with many hands making light work, most tasks are easier to manage in a team environment. By forming teams we could have broken down the workload into manageable segments or we could have hand picked our best members to work in the areas they excel at. This would have made the project much more efficient than just me working on it alone. And if we were to work as a team, a communication software such as slack makes any team orientated task much easier by allowing for seamless transfer of information and data across the digital network. 
        
        </p>
<br>
<h3> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
</h3>
    <br>
    <p>When it comes to testing digital solutions, I found myself repeating a cycle. First you encounter a problem, either a bug or an error in the code. Then you try to fix the issue yourself. If this fails then the best cause of action is to research the issue, chances are you are not the first person ever to encounter this problem. If your research proves unsuccessful then adopt a different approach. But most of the time you will be able to find the solution yourself or through research online. To avoid running into too many issues, I would recommend regular testing, as if you write a load of code at once and find something is wrong. It isn’t always obvious as to what is causing the error or issue, by regularly testing you make it very likely that the code you most recently edited is what is causing you grief. 
        </p>
<br>
<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>

<p>The content layout for my website is very simplistic. It is basically a landing page that presents information. All of the relevant information is found on the main page by scrolling down. There you will find these questions and buttons which when clicked will display the answer to the questions. The reason I initially wanted a long landing page was that it gave me a lot of room to show off my personality, hobbies and what I can/ have done in coding. Unfortunately due to time constraints I was unable to fit in as much personalisation as I would have desired. As a result the website is more of a noir movie which I am willing to accept as thematic. </p>
<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<p>In regards to constraints there are countless that a website will face. From a development standpoint this includes methods, time, cost, scope, quality, risk and many more confounding variables that can make a negative impact on a website. For example, if not enough time is given for the projects completion the end result can be extremely disappointing due to the cutting corners to reach the deadline. 

        Copyright protects intangible intellectual property; it is separate from the physical work with which it is associated. A person may own the physical painting hanging on her living room wall, but the artist still owns the copyright in the image of that painting. The person owns the physical painting subject to the artist's copyrights, and cannot make posters or note cards from the image of the painting without the artist's permission. In addition to art, you cannot legally duplicate many other common household items, including computer software, movies, and music recordings, without the copyright holder's permission. Posting copyrighted works on file-sharing programs is not only a copyright infringement, it is a crime under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005. <a href="https://info.legalzoom.com/can-copyrights-affect-you-20869.html">[6]</a>
        
        Therefore, developers have to be very selective over what assets they put onto their websites. This goes for everything from music to images and can land web developers into a copyright lawsuit if ignored. However, developers have tools and methods of getting around this issue by only using materials from open source websites, in which users post their work with the intent of it being widely used. This work is free from copyright as the creator is aware that their work will be made public domain. Alternatively, if an asset you would like to have on your website is copyrighted then you can always attempt to ask the creator for permission to use their work. 
        
        </p>
<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h3>
<p>There are many disabilities and some of them severely impact their ability to use webpages. There are however some functions we can add to offset this. For example, individuals with Parkinson's disease have very unsteady hands which can make clicking on links and buttons a painful experience. To offset this we could make all our links large buttons to minimize the impact on affected individuals. 

        Also when you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is. Therefore the use of alt tags is recommended as it is a great way for the visually impaired to understand what an image is. This also extends to putting periods in abbreviations such as CIA and C.I.A as text to speech software will read it out as the word instead of letter by letter as we would read out CIA. 
        </p>
<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
</h3>
<p>

        As long as your file types are up to date, and you are certain you are not using any outdated file types such as AppleWorks and WordStar document files, you should not encounter any issues. However, choosing the best file type for the job can require a lot of information as there are many different file types. These include text files such as ;.DOC (microsoft word document), .LOG (log File) and .MSG (outlook mail message). There are also data files such as powerpoint, audio files like .MP3, video files, 3D image files, raster/vecter image files, page layout files, spreadsheet files, database files and many more. 
        
         For my project I used .HTML, CSS and JS as these were suggested to be appropriate software. There are other web file types I could have used, but my research showed that HTML is widely supported across all operating systems as well as being supported on all web browsers which made our project more accessible by broadening the amount of platforms you can access the website on.
