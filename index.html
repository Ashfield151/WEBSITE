        Hello, my name is Daniel Ashfield, I am 25 years old, originally from London and currently living in Stockport. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. 
        I came to codenation to hone and develop my coding skills and to enter into the field which I am currently enthralled with.

<p> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
    </p>
<p>
        IT has many purposes in the modern world of business. Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). 
        One of the purposes it has in business can be simply as a landing page, providing information about the business such as location, what services they provide, what separates them from their competitors and their upcoming projects etc. However, probably the most important purpose IT has for businesses today is through E commerce. E commerce is the process of selling and purchasing through the internet. 
        E commerce is the enemy of the high street, allowing customers to make purchases from anywhere as long as they can access the internet. E commerce is great for businesses as it is another area they can assert dominance over their competition, such as having a better, more user friendly website, or simply being higher on the SEO ranking, which causes their website to have higher priority over other similar named websites during internet searches. There are many many more ways in which IT is used for modern business, such as how data is gathered and filtered to advertise your product.

        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 

</p>
<p>
        Other than the seemingly obvious such as knowing how to code, create a website, set up SEO certificate, create a domain name, pay for hosting and basic computing knowledge. Probably the most important tool to creating successful projects would be communication. While I am not in a team for this current task, the importance of communication cannot be overstated. Poor teamwork leads to inefficiency, which can mean multiple people attempting to do the same task or simply someone receiving incorrect information and acting upon it. 
        Communication leads to efficiency regardless of who it is between. Therefore communication software such as Slack can be incredibly helpful in this regard by allowing for developers to immediately be made aware of new issues or changes to the development process.

        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
</p>
<p>
        So we haven’t really been given any tasks with our website other than it has to store the information we present on this page right? We should try to put our chess board plug in on our website. Scrolling. Gif background? Gif of myself playing Apex? Music playing in the background! Definitely some RATATAT. Font? Font size? Positioning? Colours? Dark mode 100%. Also whenever I write about myself I always refer to us as we. And us? Wtf!

        Text boxes? Probably not. I think it would be easiest to make it a landing page and just have a lot of down scrolling with some side scrolling bars. Perhaps question and answers? Display question and then slide to the right to display our answers? Maybe even have a digital keyboard.

        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
</p>    
<p>
        There are many things that can go wrong with digital projects and many risks need to be managed. If it was a physical project, it could be stolen or copied and these things all apply to digital projects too. According to Step 5 Group [1] estimating that as many as 60 - 80% of all digital projects end in failure. They break down the reasoning for this high failure rate into 5 easy to understand explanations. Firstly, a lack of vision – technology evolves fast, when embarking upon digital transformation it is crucial to look beyond the technologies currently available and investigate, as well as invest in, new and emergent technologies. This is risky as new technology could be the next big thing or another technological leap that gets leapt over before the project can take off. 

        Lack of focus – the idea of delivering grand ‘legacy’ projects is appealing, especially to governments, but often large-scale projects (think, HS2, CrossRail, etc.) are costly and, when they finally come to fruition, are over-budget and outdated. Break big projects down into smaller steps allowing you to not only spot the issues as you go along but also fix them in line with the changing needs of the business and/or the market.
        
        Lack of a clear purpose – it is important to first understand the exact needs of the business and only when it is clear, define s.m.a.r.t. objectives (sustainable, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely).
        Lack of control – when it comes to digital transformation, problems are not always visible to the executive board and projects continue even when they are failing; wasting time, money and energy. By setting clear milestones in advance, and apply rigorous monitoring and analysis, you can establish a new direction and new objectives to accommodate the new needs of the business.
         
        Lack of flexibility – often contracts with government departments and many large organisations are tied to pre-agreed deliverables with little flexibility to adapt to the changing environment over the sometimes-lengthy time of the project. Consider more flexible contracts with periodic reviews of activity. 
        Taking this into consideration it is safe to say that to avoid failure in digital projects it is important to plan and remain up to date in the latest technology to save costs and avoid being made redundant by an already emerging service or competitor that could affect your projects success. Lastly, avoid projects with large companies. While this isn’t always possible on an individual level, it would appear that the further away the developer and the customer are on understanding what the other wants the less likely the project is to succeed. If working with large organisations is unavoidable then developers should take as many steps as possible to review and assure themselves that the product they are developing is the same as the product the CEO’s are expecting.

        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 


</p>
<p>
        Selecting the right kind of technology for the job can be a difficult dilemma. Most of the time developers are not given a choice in what technology and tools they employ to develop their project as this is already decided before hand either at the bosses command or the customers request. Sometimes however, freedom is granted, and the best way to use that freedom is to do research into your project to make sure there isn’t an easier solution or software that makes your work load more efficient. For example, if you were asked to make a landing page, they might ask for you to make it in javascript. But perhaps because of the extensions and plug ins they require it might be easier to use HTML instead.

        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 

</p>
<p>
        Trello;
        Trello helped me achieve my outcomes by allowing me to break the project down into segments using the Kanban methodology. This way when a task is completed I can relocate it into the completed section. By doing this I can always tell where I am up to in my projects at a glance and can therefore be more efficient in my work order. 
        
        Git
        
        GitHub

 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 


</p>
<p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU). [2]

        Controllers of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available without explicit, informed consent, and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information (which must be stored separately). No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under a lawful basis specified by the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has the right to revoke this consent at any time.
        A processor of personal data must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a processor in a common format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities centre around regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a data protection officer (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any data breaches within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.
        
        GDPR impacts digital projects because it directly limits the way companies and businesses can use an individuals data. For example, in the past if you signed up to a website and gave them your email address and phone number, there was nothing stopping them from selling your data on to third parties in an attempt to get a sale out of you. Around the end of last year GDPR rolled out across the EU which prohibits the sharing of an individual's data across companies without the individuals consent. This impacted digital agencies and projects in quite a few ways. For instance if your website stores cookies then you now have to tell the user that the website uses cookies and that they have to agree to accept them. To fail to do this could result in your company receiving a hefty fine from the EU, which is something a developer does not want to have looming over their head. 
        
        Additionally, individuals now have the right to request all information that companies have on them. You can do this with Facebook or even Tinder if you’re braver than me. By law all companies have to reveal all of the data they have stored in regards to that individual user. If you choose to do this on Facebook you will find lots of deleted and old conversations saved permanently into their databases. Thankfully with GDPR, you can also request the deletion of all data that your specified company/business has on you as well, and they legally have to oblige. 
        
        Therefore, if digital projects fail to accommodate with the laws of GDPR, it could result in fines that the company does not want. It should be quite obvious how this impacts digital projects but to put it bluntly, as a developer you could lose your job or as a company you could face a percentage based fine out of your profits.
